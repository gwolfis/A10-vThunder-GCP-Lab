> **DISCLAIMER:** This lab is a personal project and is not supported by A10. Please do not contact A10 TAC for assistance. If you have questions or suggestions, feel free to open an issue in this repository.

> **WARNING:** Deploying this lab and the A10 vThunder ADC on GCP will incur costs. You are responsible for any charges generated by your deployment.

## Introduction
The purpose of this lab is to show in simple steps how A10 vThunder ADC can be deployed in GCP.

The lab allows one to start with deploying a single A10 vThunder ADC and go through configuring SLB L4-L7 and explore the use of GCP forwarding rules to deploy ADC SLB Virtual Servers. When understanding and deploying A10 vThunder High Availability is your concern. The lab allows to deploy a second A10 vThunder ADC.
Please use the instructions within the different section understand how and to learn the different capabilities using A10 vThunder ADC in GCP.

Use of the lab works best when following the below suggested order:

1. gcp-infra  
2. slb-config
3. gcp-edge  
4. Failover

Please take your time in reading through the instructions to understand depenencies, avoid errors and gain a smooth learning experience.

## Security notes

* The self signed certificate generated by this lab is **for demo purposes only** do not use it in production.
* The `terraform-sa.json` key should be treated as a secret:

  * do not commit it to Git
  * restrict file permissions (`chmod 600 ~/secrets/terraform-sa.json`)
* For real environments consider:

  * Using Workload Identity Federation or short-lived credentials instead of long-lived SA keys
    [https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation)
  * Using managed certificates or integrating with your corporate PKI instead of self signed certs
